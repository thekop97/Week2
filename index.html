<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>I was born in London, ON, and also raised here for pretty much all of my memorable life. I transfered into IDP after going through a year of VDG here at Fanshawe and deciding it wasn't quite my cup of tea. Due to scheduling conflicts while talking with a Fanshawe career counsilor, I was somewhat forced to apply for the Winter semester (it was already Fall by the time of applying). </p>
